### The following has been implemented:
Let’s assume there is a file containing document numbers.
A document number is a string consisting of letters and digits (without special characters).
The file contains each document number on a new line, and each line contains no other information except for the document number.
A valid document number must have a length of 15 characters and start with the sequence docnum (followed by any combination of letters/digits) or contract (followed by any combination of letters/digits).
Write a program to read information from the input file – the path to the input file should be provided via the console.
The program must validate the document numbers.
Valid document numbers starting with docnum should be written to one report file.
Valid contract numbers starting with contract should be written to another report file.
Invalid document numbers should be written to another report file, with the reasons for their invalidity added after the document numbers (e.g., incorrect character sequence at the beginning, special characters in the document name, etc.).
